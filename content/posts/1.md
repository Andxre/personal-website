#Hello World

My name is Andre Dasalla and i'm currently a third year Computer Science student
attending Seattle University.

Recently, I've been teaching myself React and wanted to create something to apply
the knowledge that I've gained. The simplest way to do so was to create a personal website!

##Tech:

- GatsbyJS
- SCSS
- GraphQL

I have also decided not to use a CMS

To be honest, the hardest part about creating this website was the styling. I've never used
SCSS before, but after using it to style this site I can confidently say I will always be using
it from now on.

There is still a long way to go, and this website is far from perfect but I am glad that I
commited to making it.
