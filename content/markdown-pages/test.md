# This is a test post!

Hey there, welcome to the blog! This is my second web development project.

## Technologies:

- GatsbyJS
- SCSS
- GraphQL

Here is a code snippet demonstrating python's basic syntax:

```python
import random
print("Hello World")
x = 5
y = 10
print(x+y) # 15
```

The syntax is different in Javascript:

```javascript
console.log("Hello World") // Hello World
let x = 5
let y = 10
console.log(x + y) // 15
```
